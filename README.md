# switch-by-clap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bubnov-mikhail/switch-by-clap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bubnov-mikhail/switch-by-clap)

Arduino project to bring interactivity to a power plug like lamps, etc.  
The main unit will listen to a mic for a clap pattern and will switch an output pin on/off.  
An additional button can force the output pin to always on state.
